Feasibility Report

Tools and technology-
For our tools and technology chosen, we are going with Java as our language. We will be using Java as long as the client's  requirements  don't  change drastically.We don’t have preference on IDE since our team members will be using different IDEs.

Organization-
As of right now, we are using Discord to organize things and to set up a weekly meeting. Once we actually  start to work on the coding part of the project, we will be using Github mostly, to collaborate,  organize  and control the project  as a whole. 
We might be working on this project  with an Agile software  development  approach. And follow  along the agile practices, otherwise  not necessary.  

Need from client-
At this point, with the simplicity of the project, and the clear guidelines given before hand, we are not in need of anymore from the client at this juncture; however,  soon we will be needing more information  about input file such as, how big the list will be, how the file will be structured, even a sample file to look at would be great. 



Summary-
In Summary we are going to be focusing on the Java language, each of us will be using our personal IDE’s for ease of production. We are collaborating through a combination of discord, email, and github to organize the project. We are loosely following an Agile development approach, but with flexibility in mind, we are not tying the project down to one style. We have and require little client input at this point, though that is soon to change.  

Current  State  of the Project-
We are currently at the state of feasibility  study. We are simply  determining if this project is feasible with the current technologies  available, time and the cost as requested by the client. 

Next State of the Project- 
Next state will be determined by the client based upon the feasibility report. We can move upto design phase or re-evaluate requirements and such depending upon client’s willingness.
